## Releases of the Rocket Sundays App for auto updates

### Installation

Download the installation file from https://github.com/sundaysesport/rocket-sundays-app-releases/releases

Install the app

### Getting Started

![The user interface](/interface.jpg)

- Enter a Connection ID. This is your personal identifier.
If you share this with your streaming partner, they can connect and control the Control Panel for the stream you are running.
E.g. if aarontair is going to stream, he could use `aarontair` as the connection ID, and his partner would use the same.

- Click Start. This connects the app to receive updated from Rocket League (make sure you have it running) and the database for the Control Panel.

### As The Streamer

- Open the Overlay window and keep it open while streaming.
- Open the Pre/Post Game window and keep it open while streaming.
- The Control Panel can be open or closed as necessary.

#### Setup OBS Studio

To display the pre/post screen and the overlay, you need to add the windows as sources in your scenes
with the following settings

##### Pre/Post Game Window

##### Set the size of the windows to match your output size by right-clicking and selecting this option

### Controlling the Control Panel

All you need to do is to make sure you are using the same `Connection ID` as the streamer (if you are streaming alone you're already good to go).
